## Create Recipes

Now, we now the functionalities available in the Recipes app, let's create a meal kit recipe.

##### Step 1
Recipe app home screen has two modules: Recipes and Ingredients. Recipes module shows the number of recipes created so far and the availability of recipes.
On the Recipes module, click onto *Go To Recipes*. This will lead to new screen where we will create the recipe.

##### Step 2
Inside the Recipes module, we can view all the created recipes. Since we haven't created a recipe, the default list view is empty. Let's create a recipe.
To create a recipe, click onto *Plus*  button in the top left corner of the screen.

##### Step 3
The previous action has redirected us to a new tab where we will enter the recipe information.

 1. Recipe Title - As the name suggest, here we enter the name of the recipe. Recipe title is the single most important element for any recipe. As any other title, recipe title is a headline, and the headline in any type of context has one very powerful property - grabbing reader's attention.

 2. Add Basic Information - In this section, we will add basic descriptive information related to the recipe.
	- Recipe Type - In the recipe type, we have 3 options to select. Based on the recipe type, we can categorise the recipe either as Non-vegetarian option, Vegetarian option, or Vegan option.

	- Cuisine - In the cuisine section, we can select the cuisine of the recipe. Initially, the cuisine section will be empty. We have to create the cuisines from the Settings app >> Master Lists >> Cuisines. For this example, we have already created 3 cuisines: Indian, Thai, and Chinese. From this list, we can select the relevant cuisine based on the type of recipe.

	- Author - Including the chef's name provides rich information to the customers.

	- Cooking Time - Enter an estimated cooking time for the recipe.

	- Utensils - We've all come across one pot recipes. In one word, those are badly-advertised dishes. No one tells about the utensils used while processing the ingredients. Meal kit removes the processing of ingredients, so when we list the utensils required to cook the recipe that's all that needs to be washed.

	- Description - In this section, we can write a short description about the recipe such as providing a brief back story. Good recipe descriptions entice customers which lead to increased orders.

	Once all the relevant information are filled-in, we click on *Save* to save the information. Now, we can see all the information populated for the recipe.

3. Add Photo to Your Recipe - Using recipe photographs are a great way to visually describe the recipe. Images allow customers to picture the recipe, and when images are used properly in conjunction with recipe description, it can significantly increase sales of the recipes.

	In this section, we will add recipe images along with short title and brief description about the image. JPG, PNG and PDF are the supported formats for uploading the recipe images. After uploading the images, we can view the uploaded images in the *Images* section (next to the *Upload* button).

5. Add Servings - Recipes are created for various different serving sizes, and its ingredients change accordingly. In this section, we will add the serving size of the recipe. On clicking *Add Servings*, a new form opens up where we can add serving size one-by-one.

	For example: if the recipe has 3 different serving sizes; 2 person serving, 4 person serving and 8 person serving, we will add 2 person serving in the *Serving* field first and then click onto *Add More* to add other serving sizes respectively.

	Once all the serving sizes are added, we click on *Save* to save the serving size information. Now, we can see all the serving sizes for the recipe.

6. Add Ingredients - 

7. Add Procedure - In this section, we will add cooking steps and Chef's special notes for cooking the recipe at home. On clicking *Add Procedures*, a new form *Add Cooking Steps* opens up where we can add the cooking directions.

	On clicking onto *Add a Procedure*, a new section opens up where we can add the procedure title. To add the cooking directions for the recipe, first, we add the *Procedure Title* as Cooking Steps. Then we click onto *Add a Step* which opens up sub-section where we can add the cooking step title in *Step Title* and description about the step in the *Description* field. For adding more steps, we can click onto *Add a Step* to add another step in the cooking directions. Similarly, when the Chef provides special notes for the recipe, such special notes can also be added by creating another procedure from *Add a Procedure* button.

	A salient feature available in *Add a Procedure* is that if we want to make a particular step invisible for the audience, then it can be done by a simple push button located across *Step Title* field. Enabling this visibility button will hide the selected step from the audience. This feature can be used to safeguard the proprietary information about the recipe which we wouldn't like to share with the audience until they purchase the meal kit recipe becomes a customer.

Now we have filled all the relevant information in their respective sections. The last step to create the recipe, we push the *Publish* button on the top left corner of the screen to publish the created new recipe. This action will make it available and visible in the recipes list on the Recipe App.
