## Create Recipe

In the previous section, we covered the functionalities available in the Recipe app. In this section, we will create a meal kit recipe.

### Step 1
We start with Recipe app home screen. There are two modules: Recipes and Ingredients. To create a recipe, we select Recipes module.

### Step 2
Inside the Recipes module, we can view all the created recipes. Since we haven't created a recipe, the default list view is empty. Let's create a recipe.

To create a recipe, click onto *Plus*  button in the top right corner of the screen.

### Step 3
We are redirected to a new tab where we will enter the recipe information.

 1. Recipe Tittle - Add the title of the recipe.

 2. Add Basic information - Add basic descriptive information related to the recipe

	- Recipe Type - Based on the recipe type, categories the recipe either as Non-vegetarian, Vegetarian or Vegan.
