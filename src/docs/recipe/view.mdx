## View Recipes

In the previous section, we created and published the first recipe and added to the recipes list in the **Recipes** module. Now when we select the *Recipes* module in the Recipe app home screen, we see that the newly created recipe is visible in the recipe list.

In the list view, we can see the recipe list by Recipe Name, Author, Number of Servings and Cooking Time for the published recipes. The **View Recipes** section has functionalities to edit and delete any existing recipes.

 - Edit Existing Recipes

	To edit any existing recipes, click the recipe that has to be edited. This redirects to the recipe page, where we can edit any section of the recipe by clicking on the **Edit** button.

 - Delete Existing Recipes

	 To delete any existing recipes, we can use the **Bin** button available in each recipe row. This will entirely delete the corresponding recipe.
