## View Ingredients

In the previous section, we created and published the first ingredient and added to the ingredients list in the **Ingredients** module. Now when we select the **Ingredients** module in the Recipe app home screen, we see that the new created ingredients are visible in the ingredients list.

In the list view, we can see the ingredients list by Ingredient Name, Processing, and Created Date-Time for the published ingredients. The **View Ingredients** section has functionalities to edit and delete any existing ingredients.

- **Edit Existing Ingredients**
To edit any existing ingredients, click the ingredient that has to be edited. This redirects to the ingredients page, where we can edit any section of the ingredient by clicking on the **Edit** button.
