## Master Lists

Master lists in **Settings App** has settings configurations for data fields such **Cuisines**, **Allergens**, **Processings**, **Units**, and **Accompaniment Types**. These data fields are widely used across **Recipe App** and **Inventory App**. We had earlier noted that these data fields will initially be empty and has to be created from the Master Lists in Settings App. In this section, we are going to create the fields for Cuisines, Allergens, Processings, Units, and Accompaniment Types so that we can use these fields inside Recipe App and Inventory App.

**Step 1 - Select Master Lists**

We start with Settings App home screen. Here, we select **Master Lists** in Settings App.

**Step 2 - Create Accompaniment Types**

Accompaniments are generally defined as any additional food items that are served with the main dish. Accompaniments can be of various types such as food items like breads, sauces etc., wine & beverages, prepared or retail desserts and many other categories. Accompaniment also provides flexibility to list prepared ready-to-eat hot food which can be used to sell along with the meal kit recipes.

To create Accompaniment Type, we select the Accompaniment Types from the list.

**Step 3 - Create Allergens**

Allergens are food substances that cause allergic reaction. While any food can cause adverse reaction, eight types of food account for 90% of all allergic reactions:  eggs, milk, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, wheat, and soy.

**Add Allergens**

To create Allergens, we select the Allergens option from the list.

**Step 4 - Create Cuisines**

While creating recipes in the **Recipe App**, we had assigned a cuisine type to each recipe. We noted there that initially the cuisines section will be empty and we have to create the cuisines from **Master Lists** in the **Settings App**. In this section, we will create cuisines, so that each recipe can be assigned to its cuisine type.

**Add Cuisine**

To create Cuisine, we select the Cuisines option from the list.

![Add Cuisines](/images/master/Step4.0.png "Add Cuisines")

 - Click on the **Add** button to create new cuisine.
 ![Create Cuisines](/images/master/Step4.1.png "Create Cuisines")

 - Enter the cuisine name. We can add multiple cuisines at once by clicking on **Add New Type** button. Click on **Add** button to create and add the cuisine.
![Enter Cuisine Name](/images/master/Step4.2.png "Enter Cuisine Name")

 - New cuisine(s) are created and we can view in the **Cuisines** list. The cuisines list also provides the information on the number of recipes tagged to the corresponding cuisine.  In order to delete any of the existing cuisines, we can use the **Delete** button located in each cuisine row.

**Step 5 - Create Processings**

Processing is an important feature for ingredients. While adding **Supplier Items** in the **Inventory App**, we had declared the processing type of each ingredient as shipped from the supplier. These type of processing is also known as primary processing which makes most foods edible. While **creating ingredients** in the **Ingredients App**, we had associated processing types with each ingredient in which it has to be processed for meal kit recipes. These type of processing is also known as secondary processing which turn the ingredients into familiar foods. In this section, we will create processings which can be assigned to ingredients and supplier items.

**Add Processings**

To create Processing, we select the Processings option from the list.

![Add Processing](/images/master/Step5.0.png "Add Processing")

 - Click on the **Add** button to create new processing.
 ![Create Processing](/images/master/Step5.1.png "Create Processing")

 - Enter the processing name. We can add multiple processing at once by clicking on **Add New Type** button. Click on **Add** button to create and add the processing.
![Enter Processing Name](/images/master/Step5.2.png "Enter Processing Name")

 - New processing(s) are created and we can view in the **Processings** list. The processing list also provides the information on the number of ingredients to which the processing type is associated.  In order to delete any of the existing processing, we can use the **Delete** button located in each processing row.
![Edit/Delete New Processing](/images/master/Step5.3.png "Edit/Delete New Processing")

Since processing are associated with **Ingredients** and **Supplier Items**, processings cannot be directly delete using the **Delete** button located in each processing row. To delete any of the existing processing which are also linked either with ingredients or supplier items, it first needs to be removed from the ingredients and supplier items. Once the processing is not linked with any of the ingredients and/or supplier items, then it can be deleted using the **Delete** button located in each processing row.

**Step 6 - Create Units**

Unit is the measure of quantity. While creating ingredients or supplier items, its quantity unit was filled. In this section, we will create Units which can be assigned to ingredients and supplier items.

**Add Units**

To create Unit, we select the Units option from the list.

![Add Units](/images/master/Step6.0.png "Add Units")

 - Click on the **Add** button to create new Units.
 ![Create Units](/images/master/Step6.1.png "Create Units")

 - Enter the unit name. We can add multiple Units at once by clicking on **Add New Type** button. Click on **Add** button to create and add the Units.
![Enter Unit Name](/images/master/Step6.2.png "Enter Unit Name")

 - New Units are created and we can view in the **Units** list. In order to delete any of the existing Units, we can use the **Delete** button located in each unit row.
![Edit/Delete New Units](/images/master/Step6.3.png "Edit/Delete New Units")

Since Units are associated with **Ingredients** and **Supplier Items**, Units cannot be directly delete using the **Delete** button located in each unit row. To delete any of the existing Units which are also linked either with ingredients or supplier items, it first needs to be removed from the ingredients and supplier items. Once the unit is not linked with any of the ingredients and/or supplier items, then it can be deleted using the **Delete** button located in each unit row.
