## Master Lists

Master lists in **Settings App** has settings configurations for data fields such **Cuisines**, **Allergens**, **Processings**, **Units**, and **Accompaniment Types**. These data fields are widely used across **Recipe App** and **Inventory App**. We had earlier noted that these data fields will initially be empty and has to be created from the Master Lists in Settings App. In this section, we are going to create the fields for Cuisines, Allergens, Processings, Units, and Accompaniment Types so that we can use these fields inside Recipe App and Inventory App.
