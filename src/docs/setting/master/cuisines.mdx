## Cuisines

While creating a recipe in Recipe app, we had to select the cuisine of the recipe while adding basic information about the recipe. By default, the cuisine section was empty and it was noted that the cuisines can be created from the Settings app >> Master Lists >> Cuisines.

In this section, we will create the cuisines for the recipes that we want to create in the Recipe app.

**Step 1 - Select Cuisines from the Master Lists**
