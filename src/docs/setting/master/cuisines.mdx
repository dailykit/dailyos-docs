## Cuisines

While creating a recipe in Recipe app, we had to select the cuisine of the recipe while adding basic information about the recipe. By default, the cuisine section was empty and it was noted that the cuisines can be created from the Settings app >> Master Lists >> Cuisines.

In this section, we will create the cuisines for the recipes that we want to create in the Recipe app.

**Step 1 - Select Cuisines from the Master Lists**

In the Master Lists, select **Cuisines** from the list to add cuisines of the recipes.

**Step 2 - Add Cuisines**

We can add cuisines by clicking the **Add** button located at the top right corner of the screen.

**Step 3 - Add New Cuisines Type**

To add new cuisine type, enter a name of the cuisine in the text box. We can add multiple cuisine types by clicking **Add New Type** button. Click **Add** button to save the entered cuisines.

**Step 4 - View Cuisines**

The new cuisines are now added to the cuisines list. We can view the cuisine with Cuisine Name and Number of Recipes is which the corresponding cuisine type has been selected.
