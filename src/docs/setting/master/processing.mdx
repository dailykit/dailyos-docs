## Processings
While creating an ingredient in Recipe app, we had to select the processing of the ingredient while adding the ingredient information. By default, the processing selection was empty and it was noted that the processing can be created from the Settings app >> Master Lists >> Processings

In this section, we will create the processing for the ingredients that we want to create in the Recipe app.

**Step 1 - Select Processings from the Master Lists**

**Step 2 - Add Processings**
