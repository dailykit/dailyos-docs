## Inventory Products

Restaurants have been selling inventory products all along in various forms and across different categories. The concept of retail operations within restaurants ins't a new idea. Restaurants have been full of local products, shelves stocked with speciality ingredients and tables stacked with cookbooks. The proliferation of this model makes sense when full-service restaurants are so often dealing with razor-thin margins. A retail operation creates an additional revenue stream and more opportunities to attract repeat customers.

DailyOS **Store App** provides an option to list your inventory products which can be sold in retail format. Examples such as wine collection, home-made local products, speciality ingredients, grocery products, dairy products, daily-home products etc. can be added to your online store. In this section, we will add inventory products to create retail categories for the online store.

**Step 1 - Select Products from Seller App**
We start with Seller App home screen. To create products (inventory products), we select the **Products** module.
