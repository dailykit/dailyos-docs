## Product Types

DailyKIT allows you to sell 4 types of product 

**Simple Recipe Product**
Simple Recipe products are individual recipes which are listed on the restaurant menu. Within simple recipe product, we can create Meal Kit products as well as Ready-to-Eat recipes. DailyOS simple recipe product has provisions for adding product tags and description which makes it easy for users to quickly search products in the online store along with options to add impressive pictures of the simple recipe product.

We can select recipe(s) that we already created in the **Recipe App**, configure the product price and discounts, and add one or more accompanying products. Accompaniments within Simple Recipe product is a great way to up-sell or cross-sell more products which are complimentary in nature to the simple recipe product.

**Inventory Product**: 
Restaurants have been selling inventory products as retail items all along in various forms and across different categories.  Restaurants have been full of local products, shelves stocked with speciality ingredients and tables stacked with cookbooks. The proliferation of this model makes sense when full-service restaurants are so often dealing with razor-thin margins. A retail operation creates an additional revenue stream and more opportunities to attract repeat customers.

DailyOS **Store App** provides an option to list your inventory products which can be sold in retail format. Examples such as wine collection, home-made local products, speciality ingredients, grocery products, dairy products, daily-home products etc. can be added to your online store.

**Customizable product**: This product can have mulitple recipe options with default on one.

**Combo Product**: 
Restaurants have been creating combo products in many formats ranging from fast-food chains offering a complete meal including burger, fries, and soda based drinks to Michelin star restaurants serving 5 course menu as a complete meal option.

DailyOS **Store App** provides an option to create such combo products. These combo products can consist of a combination of Simple Recipe Product, Customizable Product and Inventory Product. Combo Product gives restaurant businesses a creative option to create various combination which are suitable for varying customer demography.
