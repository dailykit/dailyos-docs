## Simple Recipe Product

Simple Recipe products are individual recipes that we want to list on the online store. These individual recipes can either be meal kit recipes or ready-to-eat recipes. DailyOS **Store App** provide restaurants the flexibility to create a single online sales channel for their meal kit products as well as ready-to-eat recipes. In this section, we will add meal kit and ready-to-eat recipes to create Simple Recipe products.
