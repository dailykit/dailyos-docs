## Supplier Item

While setting the mode of fulfillment, either **Real Time** or **Planned Lot** mode fulfillment for ingredients, we had selected **Supplier Items** from where the ingredient was sourced to be processed and packaged as recipe ingredient. We had noted that initially the supplier items list was empty and we have to create supplier item from Inventory app. In this section, we will create a supplier item linked with a specific **Supplier** and publish the supplier item.

**Step 1 - Select Items Module**

We start with Inventory app home screen. To create a supplier item, we select the **Items** module.

**Step 2 - **Create Supplier Item**

Inside the **Items** we can view all the created supplier items. Initially, the default supplier items list view will be empty. To create a supplier item, click on the **Add** button in the top right corner of the screen.

**Step 3 - Enter Item Information**

1. **Item Name** - Enter the name of the supplier item.
2. **Item SKU** - Enter the SKU number of the supplier item.
3. **Unit Quantity** - Enter the quantity (weight, volume, etc.) of the supplier item. The quantity measurement of the supplier item can be changed from the drop-down menu located next to **Unit Quantity** field.
4. **Unit Price** - Enter the price of the supplier item. Unit price is required which essentially means price of a single unit of the corresponding supplier item.
5. **Lead Time** - Enter the lead time of the supplier item. Lead time means the time required by the supplier to fulfill the item when purchased. Lead time measurement of the supplier item can be changed from the drop-down menu located next to the **Lead Time** field.

Click on the **Save** button to save the information.

**Step 4 - Add Supplier**

Select the supplier of the supplier item from the list of available suppliers. Click on the **Save** button to save the supplier information. Initially, the list of suppliers will be empty. We can create and add more suppliers from Inventory app >> Supplier >> Create Supplier.

**Step 5 - Select Processing**

Select the processing of the supplier item. The processing of the supplier item will be the processing type as the item was shipped by the supplier. If the processing of item as shipped is not available in the processing list, then we can create and add such processing type from the Settings app >> Master Lists >> Processings. Click on the **Next** button to save the information.

After selecting the processing type for the supplier item, next we configure processing.  This section is helpful in efficiently managing your inventory.

1. **Set Par Level** - Set the safety stock PAR level for the supplier item. When the stock is running below the PAR level, we will get a notification about the periodic auto-replenishment for the selected item.

2. **Max Inventory Level** - Set the maximum inventory level for the supplier item. The maximum inventory level can also be the current inventory level or on-hand inventory level.

3. **Select Unit** - Select the unit of measurement of the supplier item from the drop-down menu. If the unit of measurement of the item is not available in the drop-down menu, then we can create and add the unit from Settings app >> Master Lists >> Unit.

4. **Add Photo to your Processing** - Add an image of processing type for quick visual reference.

5. **Labour Time per 100gm** - Enter an approximate labour time needed to process the ingredient from processing type of item as shipped to the selected processing type for creating the ingredients for the recipe.
