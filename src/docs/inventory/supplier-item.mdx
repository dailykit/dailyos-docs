## Supplier Item

While setting the mode of fulfillment, either **Real Time** or **Planned Lot** mode fulfillment for ingredients, we had selected **Supplier Items** from where the ingredient was sourced to be processed and packaged as recipe ingredient. We had noted that initially the supplier items list was empty and we have to create supplier item from Inventory app. In this section, we will create a supplier item linked with a specific **Supplier** and publish the supplier item.

**Step 1 - Select Items Module**

We start with Inventory app home screen. To create a supplier item, we select the **Items** module.

**Step 5 - Select Processing**

Select the processing of the supplier item. The processing of the supplier item will be the processing type as the item was shipped by the supplier. If the processing of item as shipped is not available in the processing list, then we can create and add such processing type from the Settings app >> Master Lists >> Processings. Click on the **Next** button to save the information.
